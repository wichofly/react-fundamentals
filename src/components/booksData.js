    title: 'Dog Man: Twenty Thousand Fleas Under the Sea',
    author: 'Dav Pilkey',
    authorImg: author1,
    bio: `When Dav Pilkey was a kid, he was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia. Dav was so disruptive in class that his teachers made him sit out in the hallway every day. 
      Luckily, Dav loved to draw and make up stories. He spent his time in the hallway creating his own original comic books - the very first adventures of Dog Man and Captain Underpants.
      In college, Dav met a teacher who encouraged him to illustrate and write. He won a national competition in 1986 and the prize was the publication of his first book, World War Won.
      His stories are semi-autobiographical and explore universal themes that celebrate friendship, tolerance, and the triumph of the good-hearted.`,

    authorImg: author3,
    bio: `I love writing stories that make children laugh and get excited about reading and drawing and writing.
    I have worked hard and have been fortunate enough to have had over 100 books published and out in the world, and love each one as if it were my child ... except if that child is like really naughty and always breaks my favourite things and writes bad words on the walls of our house.
    None of my books are like that, and imagine if you had over 100 kids! That is terrifying!.    
    From How to Catch books to How to Draw books. From gross books to action and adventure books. From rhyming to prose, inspirational to just plain silly, there's something for kids of all reading abilities, and all ranges of interests.`,
